The latest version of HTTrack mentioned in the available information is **3.49-2**, which supports Windows 2000 through Windows 10 and above. The user agent string you provided (```Mozilla/4.5 (compatible; HTTrack 3.0x; Windows 98)```) appears to be an older default identifier, but newer versions still use similar patterns unless manually changed.  

### Key Points:  
1. **Latest Version**: 3.49-2 (as of 2023).  
2. **Blocking HTTrack**:  
   - **Robots.txt**: Add ```Disallow: /``` or target paths. HTTrack respects ```robots.txt``` by default but can override it.  
   - **.htaccess**: Use rules to block the user agent:
     ```apache
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} "HTTrack" [NC]
     RewriteRule ^ - [F,L]
     ```  
   - **Server-Side**: Rate limiting or IP blocking for aggressive scraping.  

HTTrackâ€™s default behavior can be modified via its "Browser ID" tab to mimic other agents, so combining methods is recommended for robust blocking.
